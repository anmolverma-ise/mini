        <h2>Developing a system or solution to provide a customized and precise land parcel specific fertilizer and input usage plan to reduce cost and maximize returns for the farmers</h2>
        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It’s observed that farmers sometimes don’t know what type of fertiliser to use and where to get them at a good price.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Its also observed that sometimes, they don’t have a perfect input usage plan for those fertilizers and sometimes overuse/underuse it leading to less healthier crops.</li>
          <br>
          <li>The objective of this project is to devise a plan for the farmers from what fertilisers to use and how to use them in such a way that they can maximise their returns .</li>
          <br>
          <li>Our website will take information from the farmers about the types of land, types of crops they are grwoing and then suggest fertilisers to be used along with a input usage plan</li>
          <br>
        </ul>
        <h3>Scope Of Project:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The scope of this project extends wide and can be applied in the agricultural industry and can benefit the farmers financially </li>
          <br>
          <li>It doesn’t just gives an idea on the  fertilizer to be used but a range of fertilisers that can be applied so the farmers can choose from and the fertilizer input usage plan helps them to maximise their crop production leading to better and healthier crops and thus more profits in return</li>
          <br>
          <li>Furthermore, it can even be extended to the possibilities where farmers can know what types of crops they should grow based on the types of lands along with the fertilizer plan inorder to maximise their profits</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>More Insights</h3>
        <p>Agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for about 58 per cent of India’s population. Gross Value Added (GVA) by agriculture, forestry and fishing was estimated at Rs 19.48 lakh crore (US$ 276.37 billion) in FY20(PE). Growth in GVA in agriculture and allied sectors stood at 4 per cent in FY20.

            The Indian food industry is poised for huge growth, increasing its contribution to world food trade every year due to its immense potential for value addition, particularly within the food processing industry. Indian food and grocery market is the world’s sixth largest, with retail contributing 70 per cent of the sales. The Indian food processing industry accounts for 32 per cent of the country’s total food market, one of the largest industries in India and is ranked fifth in terms of production, consumption, export and expected growth.

        <h3>Market Size</h3>
        <p>
          During 2019-20* crop year, food grain production was estimated to reach a record 295.67 million tonnes (MT). In 2020-21, Government of India is targeting food grain production of 298 MT.

          Production of horticulture crops in India was estimated at a record 320.48 million metric tonnes (MMT) in FY20 as per second advance estimates. India has the largest livestock population of around 535.78 million, which translates to around 31 per cent of the world population. Milk production in the country is expected to increase to 208 MT in FY21 from 198 MT in FY20, registering a growth of 10 per cent y-o-y.

          Sugar production in India reached 26.46 MT between October 2019 and May 2020 sugar season according to Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).

          India is among the 15 leading exporters of agricultural products in the world. Agricultural export from India reached US$ 38.54 billion in FY19 and US$ 28.93 billion in FY20 (till January 2020).

          The organic food segment in India is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10 per cent during 2015-25 and is estimated to reach Rs 75,000 crore (US$ 10.73 billion) by 2025 from Rs 2,700 crore (US$ 386.32 million) in 2015.
